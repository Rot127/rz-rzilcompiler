You can use [Qualcomm's toolchain](https://github.com/quic/toolchain_for_hexagon/) to build these tests.

The easiest way is probably to just compile the toolchain with docker.
This will also build QEMU and the test binaries.

You can then copy them from the container.

Nonetheless, we have a copy of the source and binary files here for quick access.
